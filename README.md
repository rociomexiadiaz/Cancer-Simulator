# Cancer-Simulator

The file cellsim.py simulates the growth and death of a population of cells within a tissue represented as a two-dimensioned grid. Each location on the grid will represent either a Cell or Cancer; a healthy alive cell is represented as 'O' while a dead cell is represented as '.' and a cancer cell as 'X'.
